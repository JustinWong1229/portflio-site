            <h2>Career Goals</h2>
            <p> I have many career goals, one of them being to obtain my bachelor's degree from USF with good grades so that I can land a good-paying job. My second career goal is to work for a company that pays well and has a friendly working environment. Ultimately, my biggest career goal is to be able to establish financial stability and security, allowing me to live comfortably without having to worry about things like bills and other expenses. </p>
